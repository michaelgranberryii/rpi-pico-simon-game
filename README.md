# Project Title

Raspberry Pi Pico - Simon Game

## Description

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to implement the Simon game, where the terminal is used to display game information (score and level) via USB serial communication. The Simon game is a memorization game where the LEDs play a pattern, then the player must repeat the pattern back via push buttons. Each time the player inputs the correct pattern, the pattern is extended by one. This continues until the player fails.
